## Algorithmic tasks training for automation testers (Python)

Write a function that verifies whether a word is a palindrome (i.e. is it the same word with reversed letters).
The checked word can be a paramter or an input from the user.

1. Write the first idea that comes to your mind.
2. Refactor your code so that it is cleaner and more concise.
3. *Think how to increase your code's testability. Write unit tests.

[!WARNING]  
Tips below contain spoilers.

[!TIP]
* convert your parameter or input to lowercase (optionally, remove non-alphanumeric characters)
* reverse the word
* compare the original and reversed words
* to increase testability, instead of simple comparing (if), you may return a boolean variable value
